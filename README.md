# Codexly – Web Dashboard

> Part of the **Codexly** coding practice ecosystem.

## What is Codexly?

Codexly is a coding practice ecosystem built around three parts:

| Part | Description |
|------|-------------|
| VS Code Extension | Users solve coding questions directly inside VS Code |
| Backend Server | Stores user submissions and progress |
| **Web Dashboard** | Shows user analytics and progress *(this repo)* |

This repository is **only for the Web Dashboard (frontend UI)**.
